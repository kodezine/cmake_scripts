# How To Use the provided toolchains
This folder contains files for toolchains, both common and specific.

## Common Functions in each toolchain
The following is a list of common cmake functions in each toolchain. Future toolchains are obliged to have these as well.

### `showCompilerVersion`
* This function runs an executable command that determines the compiler version.

### `setTargetCompileOptions`
* This function takes one arguement PROJECTNAME that should decompose into real cross compiled `TARGET`, which can be a static library or an executable.
* This function sets the compiler dependent `target_compile_options` and makes them `PUBLIC`.

### `setTargetLinkOptions`
* This function takes one arguement PROJECTNAME that should decompose into real cross compiled `TARGET`, which is an executable.
* This function sets the compiler dependent `target_link_options` and makes them `PUBLIC`.
* This function requires the linking details like file path and filename.

### `convertELF_BIN_HEX`
* This function sets an `add_custom_command` to set various target formats of an executable `TARGET`. Popular formats are elf, bin and hex.
